Every night, the Doctor can target a player and give them almost full immunity, from every form of death except the Suicide Bomber. The Doctor cannot prevent a lynch as it is a day action.

The Doctor cannot target the same player two consecutive nights, regardless of whether they perform a save on them or not.
